🎯Building a Chat Room with Server and Client using Java RMI 🚀

I recently worked on a chat room application using Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation), which allows seamless communication between a server and multiple clients.

🔹 Key Features:

✅ Multi-client support with real-time messaging

✅ Server-side message broadcasting

✅ Remote method calls to manage communication

✅ Simple and efficient architecture using RMI

🛠️ Tech Stack:

Java RMI for remote method invocation

JavaFX for GUI implementation

Maven for dependency management

⚡ How It Works:

1️⃣ The server registers a remote object and listens for client connections.

2️⃣ The client looks up the server’s remote object and invokes methods remotely.

3️⃣ Messages sent by a client are broadcasted to all connected clients.

📌 Challenges & Learnings:

🔹 Handling remote exceptions and network failures.

🔹 Efficiently managing multiple clients with threading.

🔹 Ensuring seamless communication over a distributed system.

This project was a great learning experience in distributed systems and network programming. If you’re interested in the source code or want to collaborate on improvements, feel free to connect! 🚀
